round robin schedular

Round-robin scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm that allocates each task an equal share of the CPU time. 
Tasks are placed in a circular queue, and when a task's allocated time expires, 
it is moved to the end of the queue while the next task is taken from the front.


For stm32f407 board processor runs by default with 16MHz due to the Hight speed RC oscilator
Systick timer count clock = 16MHz
1 count it takes 0.0625us
0.0625us => 1 count 
1us => 16 count
1 ms => 16000 count 

Systick configuration , if we want a tick each N cycle , set N-1 in the SRVR systick register
because the SCVR counts down from N to 0 , when it reches 0, it not generates the ISR immediately 
it consumes one extra clock cycle to reload the count from SRVR.
